Hells-Fury is a project developed by Adithya Ajith, Edward Carey, and Ryan Willett as competitor in the Stony Brook University Game Programming Competition.

The game will be published as a Firebase app, coded entirely in Type/Java Script with the use of the Wolfie2D engine - an engine created by Joe Weaver and Richard McKenna.
