Hells-Fury is a project developed by Adithya Ajith, Edward Carey, and Ryan Willett as a final project for CSE 380 at Stony Brook University.

The game will be published as a Firebase app, coded entirely in TypeScript with the usage of the Wolfie2D engine - an engine created by Joe Weaver and Richard McKenna.
