      </h4>
     
     <div id="content">
     
       <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3> 
       <p>This document describes a game called "Hell's Fury," which is designed to be a top down, 2D dungeon crawler. This game will use sprite based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, physics, AI, side-scrolling, and more basic 2D game techniques.</p>
     <br>
     
       <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>
     
       <p>Hell's Fury will be developed using the Wolfie 2D Game Engine, which is a web based engine written in Typescript, by Joe Weaver and Richard McKenna. Our artwork will be created using Aseprite, which is a 2D pixel-based image editing software.</p>
     <br>
     
       <h3>BACK STORY</h3>
     
       <p>Zara, spurned by the legions of Hell invading aspects of her everyday life, 
         has made it her mission to march down through the demonic portal to the Kingdoms of Sin and show them what true wrath looks like. 
         Her goal is to rampage through the seven circular kingdoms of Hell, slaying as many of the demonic creatures that live there and making her way towards the center. There, she will face Pride, the ruler of the seven kingdoms and the source of her great anguish. The plot is a metaphor for the mental battle that occurs daily as Zara duels with the vices that control her.</p>
     <br>
     
       <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
     
       <p>The player's objective is to exact the fury of Zara - accruing points by defeating the legions of Hellspawn that seek to end her reign of destruction over them. The game's main goal is to defeat Pride, the leader of the demons, by first destroying his underlings who represent the other deadly sins: Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, and Envy.
      </p>
     
       <p> Each of these bosses will reside in their own circular kingdom of hell, meaning Zara has to fight her way through seven different levels to achieve her ultimate goal.</p>
     <br>
     
       <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>
     
       <p>Hell’s Fury will be a top-down, beat-em-up, dungeon-crawler style game. Zara wields melee weaponry to take down her enemies. Zara will start with 5 hit points, represented by heart containers. Damage she takes from enemies will reduce her hit points by one. Every enemy that Zara kills will have a chance to drop coins. These coins can be used to replenish health at the shopkeeper, who sells vitality potions somewhere along each circle of hell. Each level in the Kingdoms of Sin will have its own gameplay modifier based upon its ruling Deadly Sin. Pride is exempt as he is already the most powerful creature in Hell. He is so confident in his ability that he is the only enemy on his floor.
      </p>   
        
        <ul>
         <li>Sloth: Zara will have slower movement and attack speed.</li>
         <li>Envy: Enemies that attack Zara will steal her gold.</li>
         <li>Wrath: Zara will take and deal 2x as much damage - all enemies must be defeated.</li>
         <li>Gluttony: The level is slick with greases and oils from all the food the demons consume, making Zara slip as she moves.</li>
         <li>Lust: Enemies can charm Zara, forcing her to attack them.</li>
         <li>Greed: Picking up coins deals damage.</li>
        </ul> 
        
     <br>
     
       <h3>CONTROLS</h3>
     
       <p>This game will be played using both a keyboard and mouse. Once started, use the following:</p>

         <li><strong>ESC</strong> - Pause</li>
        </ul>

     <br>
